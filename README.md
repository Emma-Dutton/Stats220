# Stats220

### *My learning with Data Technologies!*

**This repo is to document my progress in my STATS 220 course at university.**

What I am currently learning:
* HTML
* Markdown Syntax
* R & R studio

My preferences in what I have learnt (1 = best)
1. Markdwon Syntax 
2. R & R studio
3. HTML

But I must say, no matter the topic, I am learning a significant amount of new knowledge in this course and **I am excited for what is to come.**
